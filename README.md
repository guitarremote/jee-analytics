Some analytics on JEE results

Datasets from JEE 2009 can be downloaded from: [Abhay Rana aka Nemo](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/)

I have analyzed the marks of JEE 2009, for which the data is freely available under RTI.

Similar analyses can be made for the datasets of JEE 2010 and above. However, the requisite permissions must be sought from [Abhay Rana aka Nemo](https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/) for 2010, 2011, and from [SDSLabs](https://jee.sdslabs.co/2012/) for 2012 onwards, since they have been released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) by them respectively.
